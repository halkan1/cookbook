# Cookbook/Meal Planner/Shopping Assistant

## Goals

* A fully fledged recipe database with little to no repeated data in the database
* Ability to create a weekly menu from recipes and calculate a summerized shopping list for ingredients in chosen recipes as well as allowing addition of items outside of those recipes.
* Creating a route thorugh the store based on ingredient classification (canned goods, dairy, etc) and sorting the shopping list by that.

## ToDos

- [ ] Clean up current code.
- [ ] Implement ingredients and steps into recipe form.
- [ ] Implement ingredient, measurement, quantity, tag, type views.
- [ ] Investigate support for float values in quantity table.
- [ ] Implement blueprints (recipes, menues, user could probably be different modules).
- [ ] Change URLs (/recipe/add, /recipe/edit<recipe>, etc would look better).
- [ ] Build function to accept underscore instead of space but convert it when querying database.
- [ ] More UnitTesting.
- [ ] Update Database schema xml to represent the current schema.
- [ ] Implement the use of Errors.
- [ ] Improve HTML code.
