# cookbook

## Goals

* A fully fledged recipe database with little to no repeated data in the database
* Ability to create a weekly menu from recipes and calculate a summerized shopping list for ingredients in chosen recipes as well as allowing addition of items outside of those recipes.
* Creating a route thorugh the store based on ingredient classification (canned goods, dairy, etc)

## ToDos

- [ ] Clean up current code
- [ ] Implement blueprints (recipes, menues, user could probably be different modules)
